## Code of Conduct
1. Purpose

While this community is for Non-Binary individuals in tech, a primary goal of this community is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the community activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Be as active as you are comfortable with.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert mods if you notice someone in distress or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that this community is a private Slack and that what individuals say or share should not be distributed off-Slack without permission.

3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate contact off Slack. If someone in Slack is not interested in talking about a certain subject or talking with you, please do not contact them elsewhere in an attempt to continue the conversation.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes, unwelcomed sexual advances, explicit photography or language, etc.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of a channel or multiple channels.

4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by DMing a mod. Your message will be kept confidential unless you give permission otherwise. You may also have another DM a mod on your behalf if you do not feel comfortable. If necessary, a means for anonymous reporting will be created.

6. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
